I suppose I don't understand non-maintainers being so passionate about restricting the scope, but you do you, as they say.

But, accepting that this is an area you have much more experience in @RyanCavanaugh, 

I don't understand why type-driven emit is thousands of times slower. You've got to check types for it to be typescript, and you've got to emit something for every AST node.
